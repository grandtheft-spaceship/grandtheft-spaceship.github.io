			The Ares Space Program began in the early 21st Century where the first humans walked on Mars during the Ares I mission. All Ares missions are a series of unmanned supply drops are deployed to Mars in order to supply the crew when they arrive. All Ares crew members travel to Mars in the Hermes, a spacecraft that uses powerful ion-engines to accelerate to extreme speeds.

		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>
			The Ares Space Program represents the best of our aspirations, and its success will forever stand as an unforgettable reminder about what we can achieve with effort, imagination, and teamwork.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Perhaps it's the innate human desire to explore that proels us to venture so far from home, but I've always suspected that it has more to do with our innate desire to know who we are and where we come from that drives our actions.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Ultimately, that curiosity about where we've been is more about knowing where we're headed.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			With that same sense of destination in mind, NASA will once again send a team of brave, dedicated explorers to Mars to further explore the past in the hopes of ascertaining our future.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			By examining the Martian terrain and its geological history, we hope to learn more about why it wound up a desiccated, inhospitable world lest we find out one day find our own planet on the same path.

		<h2>Mission Guides</h2>

		<article class="mission">
			<h3>Ares I</h3>
			<p>
				Ares I was the first mission in the Ares Program. It landed the first humans to walk on Mars; and it also allowed human-controlled tests to be carried out on the planet by hand for the first time in history. All crew members of the Ares I mission returned to Earth safely. 
			</p>
		</article>
		<article class="mission">
			<h3>Ares II</h3>
			<p>
				Ares II was the second mission in the Ares program. Much like it's predecessor, it landed astronauts on Mars to conduct scientific experiements. All crew members of the Ares II mission returned to Earth safely.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article class="mission">
			<h3>Ares III</h3>
			<p>
				Ares III was the third mission in the Ares program. Similar to the previous two missions, the main mission objective was to analyze geological features of Mars and return samples to Earth for experimentation. Ares III was the mission where astronaut <strong>Mark Watney</strong> was stranded on the planet, and was assumed to be dead. To read more about this mission, click <a href="ares3.html">here</a>.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article class="mission">
			<h3>Ares IV</h3>
			<p>
				Ares IV was a proposed mission in the Ares program. Ares IV was never inititated because of Mark Watney's premature launch of the Ares IV's MAV to the Hermes.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article class="mission">
			<h3>Ares V</h3>
			<p>
				Ares V was the fourth mission to Mars, but the fifth mission in the Ares program. Much like the previous missions, it's goal was to conduct experiments on the planet's surface with six astronauts. Ares V was the first time where an astronaut, <strong>Rick Martinez</strong>, returned to the planet's surface for a second time. 
			</p>
		</article>
		<article class="mission">
			<h3>Ares VI</h3>
			<p>
				Ares IV was the fifth mission to Mars, but the sixth mission in the Ares program. Ares VI was brought forward by Vincent Kappor to NASA's director Teddy Sanders to deliver more satellites to Mars' orbit. Ares VI was not suggested to be a manned mission.

		<h2>Equipment</h2>

		<article class="facilities">
			<h3>The Hab</h3>
				<p>
					While on Mars, crew members will be living in an artificial habitat, or Hab, for short. Designed for 31-days of use, the Hab will be filled with an array of supplies sent to the planet on fourteen unmanned supply missions. The unit itself is constructed od durable industrial canvas, capable of sheltering its inhabitants from electromagnetic waves to minimize risks from solar radiation exposure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Boasting 92 m2 of floor space, three lab tables, and two airlocks, this unit is the most advanced habitat servicing NASA today. Its state-of-the-art life support sustems are monitored by an automated smart system that actively regulates temperature, oxygen, and water.
				</p>
				<p>
					In additon to features such as the Oxygenator and Water Reclaimer, there are emergency backups for critical systems such as LED lighting and spare oxygen tanks as well as secondary and tertiary communication systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					The entire Hab is powered via solar panels arranged in a small energy farm outside the unit. Additionally, to minimalize human impact on the planet, all waste and excrement is removed through a vacuum-dried waste removal sustem that is later collected and studied by NASA scientists to examine the effect of long-duration surface operations.
				</p>
		</article>
		<article class="facilities">
				<h3>The Hermes</h3>
				<p>
					NASA's Hermes interplanetary spacecraft is a once-in-a-generation achievement that marks the beginning of a new scientific era.
				</p>
				<p>
					Featuring dozens of technological advancements, the Hermes is the direct result of a decades-long collaboration between NASA, ROSCOSMOS, ESA, JAXA, ISRO, and the global private sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Hermes was assembled in low Earth orbit with the new SpaceX Station serving as an assembly platform. Individual parts were transported to the station piece by piece. The process was tedious, but the results established a new era of space travel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Crews take a transport shuttle to and from the ship. From there, the ship's revolutionary propulsion system utlizes ion engines to churn out argon and propel the ship forward in a perfect, controlled cruise. While aboard, the ship's rotating gravity drum generates enough artificial gravity to allow the astronauts ease of mobility while protecting them from the effects of long-term weightlessness. It also features the state-of-the-art plastic shielding to insulate the ship from cosmic radiation. The ship features a powerful reactor that will power all functioning. It also offers an array of life support systems, such as its oxygenator and water reclamation processors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite these innovations, the Hermes has a relatively short lifespan. It is currently commissioned for five missions to and from Mars, and the rigors of travel are expected to render the ship unsafe for additional interplanetary travel.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, after the completion of Ares V, the Hermes is currently planned to be retooled and recommissioned as a new Internation Space Station open to astronauts from the world's established and emerging space programs.
