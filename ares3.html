	<h3>Mission Overview</h3>
	<p>
		Ares III will continue our investigation into the biological, atomospheric and geological history of Mars in an effort to learn what it was the depleted the planet's atomosphere and dried up its oceans.
	</p>
	<p>
		To that end, our team of scientists will emabrk upon a 31-day surface mission to examine Martian gullies,pseudocraters and sediment deposits for evidence of subsurface ice. Samples will be put through a range of checmical analyses to look for clues of an ancient, oxygen-rich atmosphere.
	</p>
	<p>
		The gullies found near the Acidalia Planitia landing site have been thought to be the result of erosion from steady flows of surface water. This mission will be the first time a team of researchers will be able to directly examine this particular site in the hopes of testing longstanding theories about the origin.
	</p>
	<p>
		Based upon their findings, we may not only learn about the planet's past, but its potential for engineering and sustaining life for longer-duration missions of nascent colonies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ares III was the thired manned mission to Mars after the previous Ares I and Ares II missions and are the 13th-18th people to set foot on Mars. The Ares III crew is a group of six astronauts, who are:
		<ul>
			<li>Commander Melissa Lewis</li>
			<li>Alex Vogel</li>
			<li>Rick Martinez</li>
			<li>Beth Johanssen</li>
			<li>Dr. Christopher Beck</li>
			<li>Mark Watney</li>
		</ul>

	</p>
	<p>
		Supply missions for the Ares III began on September 16th, 2033. The Ares III crew departed Earth to rendevous with the Hermes Spacecraft on June 29th, 2035 and left Earth's orbit on July 6th, 2035. The crew arrived on the surface of Mars on November 7th, 2035 and began surface operations the next day. The Ares III crew was due to depart Mars on December 5th, 2035, but was cut short after a large sanfstorm engulfed the landing site, and an emergency evacuation was ordered by NASA.
	</p>
	<h3>Stranded on Mars</h3>
	<p>
		During emergency evacuation, astronaut, <strong>Mark Watney</strong>, was struck by a communications dish and sent flying several hundred meters away from the mav. His bio-monitor readings concluded that his suit had been breached, declaring him dead. Believing him to be non-retrievable, Commander Melissa Lewis and the other four astronauts evacuated Mars before the MAV tipped over.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the journey home, the Ares III crew receiveed a message from NASA's, Mitchell Henderson, breaking the news to them that Mark Watney was still alive, and had managed to sustain himself long enough so that he could contact NASA.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Ares III crew were later informed that returning to Mars would be mutiny, and would disobey NASA's strict orders. The entire crew made the decision to return Mars and retrieve Watney. After retrieving supplies from Earth, the Hermes began the 500 day journey to Mars and back, again. The Hermes successfully retrieved Watney, and began the journey home.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a result of Mark Watney's endevour on Mars, the Ares IV mission was terminated.
